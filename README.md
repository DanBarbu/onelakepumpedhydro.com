# Energy Storage Rights — Static Export (GitHub Pages)

This folder contains a single-file static site (`index.html`) reconstructed from https://wassabi.wixsite.com/olph.

## Notes
- Images are hot‑linked to Wix's CDN (static.wixstatic.com). If any image ever stops loading, download it and place locally, then update the `src` paths.
- Forms and Wix scripts are intentionally removed for a fast, static page.
- Title and copyright updated to 2025.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create (or use) the repo `onelakepumpedhydro.com`.
2. Upload this `index.html` to the repo root.
3. In *Settings → Pages*, set **Build and deployment → Branch: `main` → `/ (root)`**.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/onelakepumpedhydro.com/`.
