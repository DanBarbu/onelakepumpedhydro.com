    <h2>Large Scale Energy Storage</h2>
    <p>Using just one lake, we make pumped hydro viable anywhere.</p>
</div>

<section class="section" id="about">
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>One Lake Pumped Hydro uses only one reservoir, making energy storage feasible even in flat terrains and arid regions. This breakthrough innovation can dramatically expand the geography and flexibility of clean energy solutions.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="how">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Traditional pumped hydro requires two reservoirs at different elevations. One Lake Pumped Hydro uses underground pressure to cycle water in and out of a single lake or tank, mimicking the same effect. Water is pumped underground and returned, providing clean, reliable energy on demand.</p>

<section class="section" id="why">
    <h2>Why One Lake?</h2>
    <p>By eliminating the need for two large reservoirs and elevation differences, this technology reduces costs, land use, and environmental disruption. It also allows installations in urban areas and deserts previously unsuitable for pumped hydro.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="sites">
    <h2>Potential Sites</h2>
    <p>From industrial zones to coastal plains, our technology opens up new regions for large-scale energy storage. Site selection is flexible, and the environmental footprint is minimal compared to traditional hydroelectric dams.</p>
